The Public Sector Panels of Consultants (PSPC) registers firms that provide consultancy services in five key disciplines. The PSPC should be adopted together with the Quality Fee Method (QFM) for the procurement of consultancy services for public sector construction projects in Singapore.

Categorisation of firms

There are five key disciplines under the PSPC:

  Architectural (AR)
  Civil/Structural (CS)
  Mechanical/Electrical (ME)
  Quantity Surveying (QS)
  Project Management (PM)
Each discipline is further divided into 4 panels with respective tendering limits on the value of projects which firms can tender for.  Each firm can apply to be listed on multiple disciplines but can only be listed on 1 panel under each discipline.

Qualifying criteria

For consultancy firms that want to be listed on PSPC, they must meet the:

General Terms and Conditions for listing on the PSPC
Qualifying criteria for the particular panel applied for subject to the listing eligibility
For consultancy firms which wish to form consortium to be eligible for Collaborative Bidding, they must meet the above criteria collectively. The consortium will be required to submit a request for verification of its eligibility to BCA (bca_pspc@bca.gov.sg) at least 5 working days before the closing of Expression of Interest (EOI) stage. Firms may refer to the guidelines for more details on the verification process. This verification process is solely for tender evaluation purpose, and the consortia verified to have met the requirements will not be on the PSPC listing.

Listing and renewal period

A firm is listed on PSPC from 1 April to 31 March annually. The annual renewal exercise is from 1 January to 15 March.
